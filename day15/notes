day15: multi task, GDT is used to describe multi tasks, each task would need to register one descreptor, each descreptor would store information for context switching including values of registers and property settings.
Then we use a repetitive timer to switch between tasks(differernt methods) every 0.02 seconds, we choose 0.02 because time spent in context switching is about 0.0001, if we switch btn tasks too often(like 0.0001), the time spent on recover context would dominate. for 0.01 or 0.02, time spent to recover only occupies 1% which would be appropriate.
Note the timer for context switching is defined in a seperate mtask.c, instead of passing values to fifo like other timers, this timer would directly call taskswithcing metdod in timer.inthalder20(), this would also make bootpack.c unaware of the context switching code
