today we implement charactor display by defining founts in a 8*16 matrix and paint it
then we include hankaku.txt as a font file and use makefont.ext to translate this file into a 256 * 16 bytes bin file that contains the byte[] font information for each ascii character
then we draw a mouse cursor(not moving yet)
also we initialize GDT(global descriptor table) and IDT(interrupt descriptor table) to move the mouse cursor
GDT has 2^13 = 8192 items, each item is called a selector, it's a 8 byte struct that defines a block of memory to be used
when a segment is assigned to assembly, its starting address will be the assembly program's ORG
