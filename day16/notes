day 16: parameterize multitasks by having a taskctl to mainaint a list of tasks
for multi tasks, sleep a task when it's not active by removing it from multi task round robin buffer
when a interruption of a task is generaeted and handled in fifo32_put(), wake up the corresponding task, this nearly doubles performance
for multi task, we implement a level strucure, the higher the level is, the more important its tasks are.
Some tasks have higher priority that when they are running(music, mousehandling etc.),
		all other tasks need to wait.
	Therefore we implement levels, the higher the level, the more important the task.
	OS will only exeute lower tasks when all upper level are empty
