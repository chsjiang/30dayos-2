day17: add a 'idle' task that's always running at the bottom level to avoid the scenario that no task is running and task_switchsub() can't find a task, idle task do nothing but io_hlt()
also enalble lowercase input by checking the key code and alter to lower case, including checking status of shift and Caps lock
then draw a command line that's able to get lower/upper case input and puncutuations
